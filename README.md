A Todo List project in React is a simple application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. It typically involves the following components:

1. **State Management**: Use React's state to manage the list of todos.
2. **Input Field**: A text input for users to add new tasks.
3. **Add Button**: A button to submit the new task.
4. **Todo List**: A list displaying all current tasks.
5. **Delete Functionality**: Options to remove tasks from the list.
6. **Edit Functionality**: Allow users to edit existing todos. This could be implemented by turning the todo text into an editable input field when clicking an edit button.
